Most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell.          
That ‘something’ wasn’t their choice.          
But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell.          
They can see something beyond the hell.          
It might be hope.          
It may even be another hell.          
Only those who keep moving forward will ever know

voyagers who chose to push themselves beyond their horizon,         
to leave the sight of shore,         
to digest the fears of getting lost(not feel, but for real),         
to sail against unknowns…          
a moment of astonishment even to think of.           
      
      
sea was surprisingly calm without big waves.       
it’s just matter of time it gets its high OR is it ?          
          
it’s not time but moon’s gravitational exert,          
time is just our calibration tool and not the action source.      
          
Beginning of Infinity.
