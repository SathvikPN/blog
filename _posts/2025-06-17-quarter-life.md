when that teenage rebel resurfaces    

- gives signal to world    
- some badass beast vibes    
- thinks of putting dent in universe    
- goes to sleep    



    
only caveat is,    
it wont take any longer than overnight sleep to see that bubble bubbling away towards the irreversible yesterday.    
    
then the same guy resurfaces after a while,    
thenafter a while, thenafter a while,    
in these thenafters,    
he gets to see things,    
tries to make sense,    
until some badass character gives the badass blow -    
    
“We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”    
    
it resonates,    
kid screams yeee-haaaaw.    
    
caveat?    
its early for him,    
words are easier to spell    
than to see them in action,    
he holds choice to choose his chase that need not be utopian as he once thought    
but significant to keep his life&style high.    
he can choose to keep the cool in these cluttered circumstances.    
    
there are things he could pick and hold on and see them marching towards dystopian future    
    
there are things he couldnt pickup and see them eatup his headspace    
    
there are things he likes to pickup but he can if only be in the utopian euphoria.    
    
well,    
this folks,    
the people before us,    
collectively called these feelings,    
quarter-life-crisis.  
    
PS: hope people gets the reference of that ‘blow-dialogue’
