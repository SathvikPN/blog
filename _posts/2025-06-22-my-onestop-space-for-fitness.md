no motivation amounts as effective as one comes from momentum of my own,         
no matter how small.

i been through pendulum swiging between feel-good physique and lower body fat sacking physique multiple times as of now.      
      
until highschool regular playtime covered physical activeness pretty much.      
at college, got into cycling since i was totalling around 8kms each college day commute as roundtrip, that involved a inverted bell curve path.      
i still remember the first week where i was out of breath and had to walk my cycle in this valley region but by the end of two years of college, i been crossing without ever getting off my bicycle.      
from the outlook, none can recognize any change but i could feel the strength and endurance upgrading, this valley path was the metric i could say.      
      
then came the college where in first half of first year, occasional weekends been running to chamundi hills, Mysuru.       
a random ones more to say.      
when amith joined, we two used to run round the railways ground.      
first day, i barely finished big ground one round in a breath but my friend been running 4 to 5 rounds at one time.      
nearly around 3 months, give or take a week, i could now make it upto 3 rounds.      
nothing to see, but i could feel endurance building.      
      
then joined hostel gym, trainer said not to do cardio since i was slender built and focus on weights. but then other things happened and couldnt keep up regularly.      
in retrospect, i laugh coz idk what busy i was compared to times now.      
      
      
For too long, "fitness" for me has been a vague goal, often associated with a gym I never quite make it to. i been there as in cycles of 3 months but was breaking for one or another reasons. gym memberships got drained coz of timings i couldnt stick to, same time everyday.

there's lot of other instances as well, but who cares.      
past is past, all i can carry forward is the learnings and       
how well i could translate them to now.      
      
i resonate with these,      
- gym is neither necessary nor sufficient,       
i wanna build myself for good feels n looks. nothing to compete for.      
- home workouts expects damn dedication,     
motivation is a wave that cant be caught everyday.     
has to blend in somehow with routine.      
- more than equipments, space matters a lot as i am in beginner arc. i subscribed to local gym, great equipments. yet outdoor running was more liberating.      
- when i been few weeks into workouts,   
felt it was actually the easier part,  
kitchen cooking was the more of skill i had lacking.   
- usually starts with goal of looking good,   
but i stay for feel-good that i get at end of each session   
coz changes takes weeks. momentum is the only motivator thats reliable.  
      
there's lot many items as i think of now, but lets move to the priority parts.  
  
i will start this fitness arc again.  
from past experiences, ik i cant keep up everyday, life happens.   
but manageable to lookout in units of a week's work.  
  
this is my think-out-loud doc to get into a good physical state in next six months or so.  
  
though decent muscles is what i am after, i had also enjoyed the endurance aspect of it. i could manage them both, not necessarily mutually exclusive.  
  
no gym.  
yes, i seen some in past,  
there's quite a realm i want to cover before diving right into building size.  
  
five pillars of physical fitness -   
1. Cardiovascular Endurance  
2. Muscular Strength  
3. Muscular Endurance  
4. Flexibility(stretch & hold) & Mobility (move across range of motion)  
5. Body Composition  
  
lets see how this goes, this time.
